Hey, It's a ReactJs web based  single page application(SPA). which helps to let you play with the features like filters. the data is fetching dynamically from the online API, i used "faker" for this. (Generate massive amounts of fake (but reasonable) data for testing and development) and this site is live and the 
url path like this : "https://shoppingcartsite0.netlify.app/"
